## Direct3D

I co-founded a startup that focuses on the development, manufacturing and sales of a **pellet extruder for 3D printing**.

I showcased our product in various trade fairs in Europe. I built and maintained professional relationships with R&D groups of industrial companies and universities in the plastics and 3D printing sectors.

See our website [here](https://www.direct3d.it) for more infos. We are also active on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/direct3d-pellet-extrusion/).

## Publication

For my Bachelor's degree thesis project I developed and tested an efficient methodology for manufacturing realistic 3D cerebrovascular phantoms resembling brain arteriovenous malformations for applications in stereotactic radiosurgery.

More in details, I elaborated the brain computed tomography data acquired from patients and developed two main manufacturing techniques, involving 3D print and the use of tissue-equivalent materials for radiology, for the phantoms' fabrication. I tested the radiological response of these phantoms and compared it with the one of the clinical cases. Results were very good and suggested that these systems have potential to be used as enabling tools for radiosurgery pre-planning, quality assurance and medical research.
