## Direct3D

In 2018 I co-founded a startup that focuses on the development, manufacturing and sales of a **pellet extruder for 3D printing**.

Compared to the traditional filament printing method, Direct3D pellet extruder enables our customers to increase productivity, select among a wider range of materials and reduce printing costs. For more information, visit our [website](https://www.direct3d.it) or find us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/direct3d-pellet-extrusion/).

Our primary customers are R&D groups of industrial companies and universities in the plastics and 3D printing sectors. I have built and maintained professional relationships with clients, both for sales and technical assistance. Additionally, I have showcased our product at various trade fairs across Europe.

## Research in medical technologies

For my Bachelor's thesis, I developed and tested an efficient methodology for manufacturing realistic **3D cerebrovascular phantoms** that replicate brain arteriovenous malformations, intended for use in stereotactic radiosurgery.

I processed brain computed tomography (CT) data acquired from patients and 3D-printed phantoms of the scanned malformations using tissue-equivalent materials for radiology. I then tested these phantoms' radiological response and compared it with the original clinical data. The outcomes were promising, suggesting that these systems could be valuable tools for radiosurgery pre-planning, quality assurance and medical research.

This project was conducted at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Nanostructured Materials and Interfaces ([CIMaINa](https://cimaina2.fisica.unimi.it/)) and was the first initiative of the [PRINTMED-3D](https://printmed-3d.com/en/) project, which had just started at the University of Milan.
