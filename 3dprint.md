## Direct3D

In 2018 I co-founded a startup that focuses on the development, manufacturing and sales of a **pellet extruder for 3D printing**.

Compared to the traditional filament printing method, Direct3D pellet extruder enables our customers to increase productivity, select among a wider range of materials and reduce printing costs. See our website [here](https://www.direct3d.it) for more info. We are also active on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/direct3d-pellet-extrusion/).

Our main customers are R&D groups of industrial companies and universities in the plastics and 3D printing sectors. I built and maintained professional relationships with them, both for sales and for assistance. I also showcased our product in various trade fairs in Europe.

Direct3D has a record of growing sales and profit. As a committed scientific researcher I operate in a consultancy role during my studies.

## Publication

For my Bachelor's degree thesis project I developed and tested an efficient methodology for manufacturing realistic 3D cerebrovascular phantoms resembling brain arteriovenous malformations for applications in stereotactic radiosurgery.

Specifically, I elaborated the brain computed tomography data acquired from patients and developed two main manufacturing techniques, involving 3D print and the use of tissue-equivalent materials for radiology, for the fabrication of the phantoms. I tested the radiological response of these phantoms and compared the data with the one of the clinical cases. Results were very good and suggested that these systems have the potential to be used as enabling tools for radiosurgery pre-planning, quality assurance and medical research.

I published this work as first author: <br>
