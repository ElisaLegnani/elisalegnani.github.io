## Hobbies

I am an outdoor activities enthusiast. The ones I like most are **mountain trekking** and **cycling**. I also enjoy taking photos of the stunning landscapes I encounter on my way.

Sometimes I get tired of constantly moving around, and I love **drawing** and **reading**.

As a programming enthusiast and (somehow good) artist, I also enjoy doing some simple **web design**. Here are a few examples of websites I built during my free time: [Feel@Home](https://www.feelathome.eu/) and [Direct3D](https://www.direct3d.it/).

### Private lessons and Scouting
 
Since I was in high school I used to help younger students for their math and physics studies, with individual or small group private lessons. It is my preferred way of doing outreach and teach scientific reasoning, as it allows me to reach individuals and to deepen concepts that in a public audience are harder to explore.

As I value **education**, I also have been a scout leader of 12-16 years old kids for five years. This involves attending weekly meetings, yearly camps, and other events, and working alongside an adult leadership team to plan and run activities that engage young people and fit an educational programme.

Both these experiences played a great role in my team working and leadership abilities and communication skills. I also learned to plan systematically, but think creatively at the same time.
