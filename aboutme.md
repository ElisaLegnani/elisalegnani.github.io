I am originally from Milan, a city in northern Italy. I lived there throughout my education and completed both my Bachelor's and my Master's degrees in Physics at the University of Milan. During the last year of my Master's I moved to Munich to join Daniel Gruen's group on *Astrophysics Cosmology and Artificial Intelligence* ([ACAI](https://www.physik.lmu.de/observatory/en/research/cosmology-at-usm/acai-group/)) at the Ludwig Maximilians University for a year long research stay funded by my university. I am now a PhD student in the *Observational Cosmology* group at [IFAE](https://www.ifae.es/groups/cosmology) in Barcelona.

## Hobbies

I am an outdoor activities enthusiast, particularly passionate of **mountain trekking** and **cycling**. I also like taking photos of the stunning landscapes I come across along the way. Spending time in nature, especially in the Alps and now in the Pyrenees, has deepened my love for animals and plants, and also strengthened my resilience and ability to find solutions using simple means.

When I need a break from constantly moving around, I enjoy **drawing** and **reading**, as well as taking care of plants. I also love **hands-on work** and DIY projects, embracing a reuse-and-repair mindset that challenges my creativity.

As a programming enthusiast and (somehow good) artist, I also enjoy doing some simple **web design**. Here are a few examples of websites I built during my free time: [Feel@Home](https://www.feelathome.eu/) and [Direct3D](https://www.direct3d.it/).

### Education and outreach

Since high school, I have been tutoring younger students in math and physics, offering idividual and small group sessions to make complex scientific concepts more accessible and engaging. Additionally, I served for five years as a scout leader for 12- to 16-year-olds, collaborating with a team to plan and lead weekly meetings, camps, and events aligned with an educational program. 
<!---* These experiences have strengthened my teamwork, leadership, and communication skills, as well as my ability to plan systematically while thinking creatively. *--->
