<!---* I am originally from Milan, a city in northern Italy. I lived there throughout my education and completed both my Bachelor's and my Master's degrees in Physics at the University of Milan. During the last year of my Master's I moved to Munich to join [Daniel Gruen](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/about-us/people/gruen-2.html)'s group on *Astrophysics Cosmology and Artificial Intelligence* at the Ludwig Maximilians University for a year long research stay funded by my university. I am now a PhD student in the *Observational Cosmology* group at [IFAE](https://www.ifae.es/) in Barcelona.  *--->

## Hobbies

I am an outdoor activities enthusiast, particularly passionate of **mountain trekking** and **cycling**. I also like taking photos of the stunning landscapes I come across along the way. Spending time in nature, especially in the Alps and now in the Pyrenees, has deepened my love for animals and plants, and also strengthened my resilience and ability to find solutions using simple means.

When I need a break from constantly moving around, I enjoy **drawing** and **reading**, as well as taking care of plants. I also love **hands-on work** and DIY projects, embracing a reuse-and-repair mindset that challenges my creativity.

As a programming enthusiast and (somehow good) artist, I also enjoy doing some simple **web design**. Here are a few examples of websites I built during my free time: [Feel@Home](https://www.feelathome.eu/) and [Direct3D](https://www.direct3d.it/).

### Private lessons and Scouting
 
Since high school, I have been helping younger students with their math and physics studies through individual and small group lessons. This personalized approach is my preferred method for **outreach** and teaching scientific reasoning, as it allows for in-depth exploration of concepts that are often harder to address in a larger public setting.

As I value **education**, I also have been a scout leader of 12-16-year-olds over a five-year period. This role involved organizing weekly meetings, annual camps, and various events, working with a leadership team to plan and run activities that are both engaging and fit an educational programme.

Both of these experiences have significantly developed my teamwork, leadership, and communication skills, as well as my ability to plan systematically while thinking creatively.
