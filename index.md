I am a PhD student in Physics in the *Observational Cosmology* group at [IFAE](https://www.ifae.es/) in Barcelona. My aim is to contribute to our understanding of the large-scale structure of the Universe using innovative statistical and software solutions applied to complex cosmological survey datasets.

My background includes professional and research experience in 3D printing. I am passionate about computer science and software engineering, and I thoroughly enjoy problem-solving in general.

<!---* particularly in advancing data analysis techniques across various fields of study.  *--->

<!---* I am originally from Milan, a city in the north of Italy. I lived in there through all my education, and studied for both my Bachelor and my Master in Physics at the University of Milan. During the last year of my Master I moved to Munich to join [Daniel Gruen](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/about-us/people/gruen-2.html)'s group on *Astrophysics Cosmology and Artificial Intelligence* at the Ludwig Maximilians University for a year long research stay funded by my University. *--->

## Research interests

Here is what I am passionate about in my studies and research experiences.

### Cosmology

My overarching goal is to contribute to building an improved model of the Universe by applying innovative **statistical and artificial intelligence techniques** to cosmological surveys datasets.

I am currently working on improving intrinsic alignment modelling for the [Dark Enery Survey](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) Year 3 **cosmic shear** analyses using artificial intelligence algorithms and deep many-band imaging. My goal is to uncover and use the scaling of lensing source galaxies’ intrinsic alignment with their physical properties.

See the [Cosmology](https://elisalegnani.github.io/cosmology) page for details on my current project or if you want to learn about what I like in astrophysics and cosmology.

### 3D print

I co-founded [Direct3D](https://www.direct3d.it/), a startup dedicated to developing, manufacturing, and selling a pellet extruder for 3D printing.

Combining my expertise in this field with my background in physics, I authored a paper detailing a novel method I developed for manufacturing realistic 3D cerebrovascular phantoms to be used in radiosurgery applications.
