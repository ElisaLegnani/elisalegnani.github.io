I am a physicist doing research for my Master thesis at the Ludwig Maximilians University (LMU) in Munich.

### Research interests

#### Cosmology

#### 3D print

### Hobbies

I like outdoor activities, especially mountain trekking and cycling. I also enjoy taking photos of the stunning landscapes I encounter on my way.

In times of bad weather, I love drawing and reading.
