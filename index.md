I am a PhD student in Physics in the *Observational Cosmology* group at [IFAE](https://www.ifae.es/) in Barcelona. My aim is to deepen our understanding of the large-scale structure of the Universe using advanced statistical and software solutions to tackle complex cosmological datasets.

My background includes professional and research experience in 3D printing. I am passionate about computer science and software engineering, and I thoroughly enjoy problem-solving in general.

## Research interests

### Cosmology

My overarching goal is to contribute to building an improved model of the Universe by analyzing galaxy survey data using innovative statistical and artificial intelligence techniques.

I am involved in the weak lensing analyses with the final dataset of the Dark Energy Survey ([DES](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/)), the leading lensing experiment to date, and on the preparation of the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time ([LSST](https://lsstdesc.org/)).

For more details on my current projects and my interests in astrophysics and cosmology, please visit the [Cosmology](https://elisalegnani.github.io/cosmology) page.

### 3D print

I co-founded [Direct3D](https://www.direct3d.it/), a startup dedicated to developing, manufacturing, and selling a pellet extruder for 3D printing.

Combining my expertise in this field with my background in physics, I developed a novel method for manufacturing realistic 3D cerebrovascular phantoms to be used in radiosurgery applications.
