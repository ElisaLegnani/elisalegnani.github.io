I am a physicist at the University of Milan and I am currently doing research in cosmology for my Master thesis at the Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich.

I am originally from Milano, a city in the north of Italy. I lived in there through all my education, and moved to Munich a few months ago to join Daniel Gruen's *Astrophysics Cosmology and Artificial Intelligence* group. I look forwar to starting a PhD in astrophysics next semester.
