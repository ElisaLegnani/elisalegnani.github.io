I co-founded a startup that focuses on the development, manufacturing and sales of a pellet extruder for 3D printing.

I showcased our product in various trade fairs in Europe. I built and maintained professional relationships with R&D groups of industrial companies and universities in the plastics and 3D printing sectors.
