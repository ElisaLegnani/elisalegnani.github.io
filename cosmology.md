<!---*The properties of dark matter and energy, which make up 95% of the Universe, affect how matter is distributed on large scales and how it has evolved over time. We study this distribution by mapping the positions of galaxies (in orange  in the picture) and studying the effect of the distortion of the shapes of more distant galaxies (in yellow) caused by gravitational lensing, more specifically using correlation fnction to condense the information.

We can actually “see” how the universe has evolved since the formation of the earliest galaxies, thanks to the fact that light takes time to travel. The further away in space we look, the further we look back in time. By mapping out the location of galaxies all around us, we can study both the large-scale structure of matter in the universe, and how it has changed over time.

By measuring source galaxy shape correlations, one can study the geometry of the Universe as well as the properties and time evolution of structure at large scales. 

The main DES Year 6 cosmology papers will analyze these maps with three measurements: cosmic shear, galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing, to give us our best understanding of the dark universe.*--->
