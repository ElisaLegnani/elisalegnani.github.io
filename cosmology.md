<!---* Illustris Simulation. Time evolution of a 10Mpc (comoving) region within Illustris from the start of the simulation to z=0. The movie transitions between the dark matter density field, gas temperature (blue: cold, green: warm: white: hot), and gas metallicity. *--->

<!---*The properties of dark matter and energy, which make up 95% of the Universe, affect how matter is distributed on large scales and how it has evolved over time. We study this distribution by mapping the positions of galaxies (in orange  in the picture) and studying the effect of the distortion of the shapes of more distant galaxies (in yellow) caused by gravitational lensing, more specifically using correlation fnction to condense the information.

We can actually “see” how the universe has evolved since the formation of the earliest galaxies, thanks to the fact that light takes time to travel. The further away in space we look, the further we look back in time. By mapping out the location of galaxies all around us, we can study both the large-scale structure of matter in the universe, and how it has changed over time.

By measuring source galaxy shape correlations, one can study the geometry of the Universe as well as the properties and time evolution of structure at large scales. 

The main DES Year 6 cosmology papers will analyze these maps with three measurements: cosmic shear, galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing, to give us our best understanding of the dark universe.*--->

### Intrinsic alignments

<img class="post-img" width=180 align="right" src="/assets/img/IAguide.png"/>

A condensed overview of common notations and concepts relevant for describing the intrinsic alignment (IA) of galaxies. 

<!---*Designed as both an introduction for someone new to the field and a reference for those already familiar with IA, this resource presents a collection of IA formalisms, estimators, modeling approaches, alternative notations, and useful references.*--->

### Cosmic shear with blue galaxies

<img class="post-img" width=180 align="right" src="/assets/img/blueshear.png"/>

A cosmic shear reanalysis of the DES Y3 data limited to a pure sample of blue, star-forming galaxies, which is expected to be less impacted by IA. 

<!---*The cosmological parameter constraints from this blue sample are stable to IA model choice, unlike the passive galaxies in the full DES Y3 sample, the goodness-of-fit is improved and the Ω<sub>m</sub> and S<sub>8</sub> better agree with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background observations. Mitigating intrinsic alignments via sample selection, instead of flexible model choices, can reduce uncertainty in S<sub>8</sub> by a factor of 1.5, with less uncertain IA on small scales.*--->
